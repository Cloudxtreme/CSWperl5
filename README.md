# CSWperl
OpenCSW build recipes for up to date perl Solaris packages (s10/11+sparc/x86-64).

OpenCSW (pronounced open-cashew /ˈkæʃuː/) is an easy to use open source software distribution installable on top of Solaris and Solaris-based systems. OpenCSW is a community project dedicated to working closely with upstream projects to improve portability of open source software.

OpenCSW Solaris packages are provided in the OS-native SVR4 format.  We publish both binary packages and source package definitions, making it possible for others to build on top of OpenCSW’s work.
